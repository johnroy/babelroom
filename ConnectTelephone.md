## General Notes ##
  * The server FreeSWITCH configuration expects incoming SIP traffic from PSTN on port 5080 (external). Port 5060 is for direct SIP connects from [SIP clients](FAQ#SIP_Clients.md). Some features of dialplan configuration (such as pinless meeting entry) will not work correctly if these port assignments are not correct.
