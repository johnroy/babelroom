## Do You Really Need a Server? ##
You don't need a server just to try out babelroom. You can join the shared demo room here: [here](https://bblr.co/demo) -OR- signup [here](http://babelroom.com/signup) and get your own online room.

## Private Cloud Server ##
BabelRoom cloud server runs on bare install of Linux CentOS6.3. The installation process is designed to result in a very specific, known software set.

While there is nothing precluding anybody from using the source on [Github](https://github/babelroom/clouds) to attempt an install on a different operating system that would be highly inadvisable. Read more on this topic [here](WhyUseStandard.md).

## How ##
There are 3 options to get a private server:

  * Build from ISO
  * Run a pre-installed VM
  * Run a pre-installed Amazon instance

### Build From ISO ###
Go to [MinimalToSetups](MinimalToSetups.md)

### Run a Pre-installed VM ###
Go to [VMInstance](VMInstance.md)

### Run a Pre-installed Amazon Image ###
Go to [AmazonInstance](AmazonInstance.md)
